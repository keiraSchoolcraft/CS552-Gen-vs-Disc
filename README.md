# Assignment 2

Naive Bayes vs. Logistic Regression

I joined this class on 1/26, so I only had so much time to complete this. I hope it's okay that I've turned it in so late!

Not 100% sure how much to put in this README because it's mostly just in the notebook itself and I haven't seen any other instructions!

### Installation

Clone the repo, create the venv:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   
And activate:

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

Then install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
